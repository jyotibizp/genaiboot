## Potential Enhancements

### Content Additions
- **Safety & Ethics Module**: Consider adding content about AI safety, bias detection, and responsible AI practices
- **Fine-tuning Section**: Maybe add a module on fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, QLoRA) in the LLM fundamentals
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: More emphasis on evaluation metrics for different AI tasks
- **Cost Optimization**: Dedicated section on optimizing API costs and efficiency

### Structure Improvements
- **Prerequisites Check**: Add a pre-assessment to ensure learners have necessary Python/ML background
- **Peer Review Process**: Include peer code reviews in the submissions workflow
- **Industry Case Studies**: Add real-world case studies in reference materials

### Practical Suggestions
- **Docker Integration**: The docker-compose.yml suggests containerization - ensure all exercises work in containers
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Consider adding automated testing for submitted code
- **Resource Management**: Include guidance on managing API keys and rate limits across the cohort

### Assessment Refinements
- **Rubrics**: Define clear grading rubrics for projects
- **Portfolio Development**: Help learners build a portfolio throughout the bootcamp
- **Industry Presentation**: Final project presentations to simulate real-world demos
